GGCode
======

GGCode is a small Google Maps API Geocoder using the Google Maps API v3.

Usage is extremely easy:

1. Add to your gemfile

    gem 'ggcode', :git => 'https://gist.github.com/bulters/5133207'

2. bundle

Reason I'm using this micro-gem is that the Graticule gem does not support the Google Maps API v3 and v2 is recently retired (8-3-2013).
